In Exercises 1-3, go through the steps of analysis of variance hypothesis testing to see if you can conclude that there is a difference among population means. Construct boxplots of the data. Let α = .05 for each test. Use Tukey’s HSD procedure to test for significant differences among individual pairs of means (if appropriate).  
1. Researchers at Case Western Reserve University wanted to develop and implement a transducer, manageable in a clinical setting, for quantifying isometric moments produced at the elbow joint by individuals with tetraplegia (paralysis or paresis of all four limbs). The apparatus, called an elbow moment transducer (EMT), measures the force the elbow can exert when flexing. The output variable is voltage. The machine was tested at four different elbow extension angles, 30, 60, 90, and 120 degrees, on a mock elbow consisting of two hinged aluminum beams. The data are in EXR_C08_S02_01.csv.  
2. Ilich-Ernst et al. investigated dietary intake of calcium among a cross section of 113 healthy women aged 20–88. The researchers formed four age groupings as follows: Group A, 20.0–45.9 years; group B, 46.0–55.9 years; group C, 56.0–65.9 years; and group D, over 66 years. Calcium from food intake was measured in mg/day. The data in EXR_C08_S02_03.csv are consistent with summary statistics given in the paper.  
3. In a study by Wang et al. researchers examined bone strength. They collected 10 cadaveric femurs from subjects in three age groups: young (19–49 years), middle-aged (50–69 years), and elderly (70 years or older) Note: one value was missing in the middle-aged group. One of the outcome measures (W) was the force in Newton required to fracture the bone. The table in EXR_C08_S02_05.csv has the data for the three age groups.
