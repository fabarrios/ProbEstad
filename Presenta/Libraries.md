## Some recommended libraries  
This is a list (incomplete most probably) of R libraries (packages) that we will be using to work and solve the examples. Can be installed like R packages.  
The easiest way to install is un RStudio, go to the Packages screen (at the right down quadrant) and use the "Install" button.
